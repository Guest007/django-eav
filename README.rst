django-eav
==========

The Isotoma Fork
----------------

There are over forty forks of this unmaintained project now so to summarise the
goals of our fork:

  - Allow further extensibility of the BaseEntityForm so that the attributes
    shown can be further filtered per-form-instance. The use-case is when there
    is data in the request that affects the values you show on your form that
    cannot be passed to the get_attributes method on an EavConfig object.

  - Use a ModelChoiceField for the EnumValue drop down entries, to fix a bug
    where ``Must be an EnumValue model object instance`` validation errors were
    raised whenever a value was set on a drop-down.

  - Fix up the setup.py configuration and add a MANIFEST.in to allow us to
    package the application.

  - Fix bugs as we find them, ideally pulling in patches from other forks where
    possible.

  - Fixes the slug validation where hyphens were previously valid


The Guest007 Fork
-----------------

Adaptation for my needs. Integrate interesting changes from other forks.


Introduction
------------

This is a fork of https://github.com/mvpdev/django-eav, to make it Python 3,
Django 1.9 compatible and for other needs.


django-eav provides an Entity-Attribute-Value storage model for django apps.

For a decent explanation of what an Entity-Attribute-Value storage model is,
check `Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model>`_.

.. note::
   This software was inspired / derived from the excellent `eav-django
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eav-django/1.0.2>`_ written by Andrey
   Mikhaylenko.
   
   There are a few notable differences between this implementation and the
   eav-django implementation.
   
   * This one is called django-eav, whereas the other is called eav-django.
   * This app allows you to to 'attach' EAV attributes to any existing django
     model (even from third-party apps) without making any changes to the those
     models' code.
   * This app has slightly more robust (but still not perfect) filtering.


Installation
------------

From Github
~~~~~~~~~~~
You can install django-eav directly from guthub::

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/guest007/django-eav.git#egg=django-eav

Usage
-----

Edit settings.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add ``eav`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's ``settings.py`` file.

Register your model(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you can attach eav attributes to your model, you must register your
model with eav::

    >>> import eav
    >>> eav.register(MyModel)

Generally you would do this in your ``models.py`` immediate after your model
declarations.

Create some attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    >>> from eav.models import Attribute
    >>> Attribute.objects.create(name='Weight', datatype=Attribute.TYPE_FLOAT)
    >>> Attribute.objects.create(name='Color', datatype=Attribute.TYPE_TEXT)


Assign eav values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    >>> m = MyModel()
    >>> m.eav.weight = 15.4
    >>> m.eav.color = 'blue'
    >>> m.save()
    >>> m = MyModel.objects.get(pk=m.pk)
    >>> m.eav.weight
    15.4
    >>> m.eav.color
    blue

    >>> p = MyModel.objects.create(eav__weight = 12, eav__color='red')

    >>> attribute_slug = 'weight'
    >>> value = 42.0
    >>> m.eav.__dict__[attribute_slug] = value


Get attribute's value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    >>> attribute = Attribute.objects.get(slug=weight)
    >>> m.eav.get_value_by_attribute(attribute).value
    42.0


Filter on eav values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    >>> MyModel.objects.filter(eav__weight=15.4)

    >>> MyModel.objects.exclude(name='bob', eav__weight=15.4, eav__color='red')
